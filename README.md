## General
A tool to merge SEAnim files.
### Features:
- Merge multiple anims.
- Bone Modifiers, Notetracks, etc. kept.
- Easy to use Drag and Drop interface.
### Notes:
- Animation order is based off file's name, alphabetical.
- Tool has only been tested on Weapon Anims (as is it was made for fire/settle animations).
- Merged SEAnim will be an "absolute" anim.

## How to use
To use simply drag and drop animations onto the drop box or Click "Load Anims" and select the anims you wish to merge. Then choose where to save the merged anim. 

When importing anims make sure to names the files a-z in the order you want the anims merged, as the tool sorts them a-z to determine order. A future update will allow manual selection of anim order.
